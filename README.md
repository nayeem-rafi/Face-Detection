# Face Detection
 This MATLAB script detects faces in an image using the vision.CascadeObjectDetector. It reads an image, converts it to grayscale for improved accuracy, and identifies faces by drawing bounding boxes around them. If no faces are detected, the original image is displayed without annotations.

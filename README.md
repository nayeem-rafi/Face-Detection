# Face Detection

This MATLAB script detects faces in an image using the built-in Cascade Object Detector. The script loads an image, converts it to grayscale for improved detection accuracy, and uses a pre-trained face detector to identify faces, drawing bounding boxes around detected faces.

## Features

- Uses MATLAB's built-in `vision.CascadeObjectDetector` to detect faces in images.
- Converts images to grayscale to enhance detection reliability.
- Annotates detected faces with bounding boxes in the original image.
- Displays the image with or without detected faces.

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB 
- Computer Vision Toolbox

## How to Use

1. Place your input image in the same directory as the script.
2. Replace `'image.jpg'` in the code with your image filename.
3. Run the script in MATLAB.
